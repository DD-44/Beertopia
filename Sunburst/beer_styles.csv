Ale,,#FFAD00,--,--,"An Ale is a beer that is produced with a top fermenting yeast strain. In general, ales are fermented at warmer temperatures (60-70 F) and for a shorter period of time (2-3 weeks) than lagers. Most top fermenting yeasts strains  produce phenols, which impart spicy undertones to a beer, and esters, which provide fruit characteristics. Like lagers, ales can range dramatically in color from straw-gold to black, and can be found with a huge variance in strenght, from 0.5% ABV to more tha 15% ABV."
Mixed Styles,,#F0F0F0,--,--,"Some beers are better defined by a distinct characteristic imparted during the production process (addition of fruit or spices, wood aging, smoking of malt, etc.), rather than the type of yeast used (ale or lager) during fermentation. These beers are classified as ""Mixed""."
Lager,,#FFF597,--,--,"A Lager is a beer that is produced with a bottom fermenting yeast strain. In general, lagers are fermented at cooler temperatures (40-50 F) and for a longer period of time (4-6 weeks) than ales. Most bottom fermenting yeasts strains do not produce flavor or aroma altering compounds commonly found in ales, so the characteristics of lagers are usually straightforward, and come mostly from malt and hops. Like ales, lagers can range dramatically in color from straw-gold to black, and can be found with a huge variance in strenght, from 0.5% ABV% to more than 12% ABV."
Belgian / French Ale,Ale,#CF6900,4.0-14.0%,10-80,"Belgian and French Ale style beers possess a really huge range of flavors, colors and strengths. Some truly defy description and classification. But no matter what kind of beer we are talking about here, weak or strong, light or dark, sour or sweet, these beer styles are all brewed with special yeasts that impart the typical characteristics we all know of as ""Belgian"". Belgian brewers employ methods of brewing which sometime fly in the face of the established ""norms"". This might include processes such as high temperature fermentations, or their lack of fear in using native ""wild"" yeasts and bacteria or any and all kinds of adjuncts and spices.
Belgian yeast evolved through artificial selection to produce high levels of esters (fruity notes) and phenols (spicy notes such as pepper, cloves, etc). High fermentation temps, sometimes in the upper 80's °F and up accentuate or exaggerate these flavor and aroma characteristics. The use of wild yeast and lactic acid producing bacteria is another hallmark of Belgian beers. 
One other characteristic which sets Belgian and French Ale apart is the use of adjuncts. Belgian brewers have never been afraid of using a multitude of spices and different types of sugar (mostly made from beets) in their brews. Not all ales in this category will use spices and/or sugar, but when it is used, you normally can't reproduce the style without them."
Other,Mixed Styles,#F0F0F0,--,--,See parent or child style for the description.
American Lager,Lager,#FFCA5A,2.5-6.0%,8-45,"The pale lager-style beer originated in Europe in the mid-19th century, and moved to the US with German immigrants. As a general trend outside of Bavaria and the Czech Republic where the beers may be firmly hopped, pale lager developed as a modestly hopped beer, and sometimes used adjuncts such as rice or corn – and this was also true in the US.
Other terms for this type of beer, or sub-categories within it, include ""adjunct lager"", ""American-style light lager"", ""American-style low-carbohydrate light lager"", ""American-style lager"", ""American-style premium lager"" (a term used at the World Beer Cup), ""North American style-lager"" and ""North American-style premium lager""."
Pale Ale,Ale,#CB6200,3.0-12.0%,15-100,"In the 19th century, ales that were pale in color were often called “pale ale” or “bitter” interchangeably. Some historians point to brewing records from about 150 years ago, when these beers were referred to as “bitter ales” to distinguish them from the sweeter brown ales and mild ales of the day.
It is only in modern times that a distinction is made between pale ale and bitter, but even that division is blurry. Some consider the manner of dispensing the beer as the decisive factor: if the beer is served on draft, it would be called a bitter; if in a bottle, pale ale. No matter which name is used, these are the traditional beers of the English pub.
American brewers—who tend to shy away from the name “bitter”—make pale ales both in the more restrained English tradition and the more assertive American style.
Pale ale is essentially the beer that launched the modern brewing revolution in America, and one beer in particular deserves much of the credit."
Brown Ale,Ale,#B04500,3.0-8.8%,15-45,"Brown ale is a style of beer with a dark amber or brown colour. The term was first used by London brewers in the late 17th century to describe their products, such as mild ale, though the term has a rather different meaning today. 18th century brown ales were lightly hopped and brewed from 100% brown malt.
Today there are brown ales made in several regions, most notably England, Belgium and America. Other than being top-fermented and having a darker color than pale beers, brown ales share little in common in terms of flavour profile. 
They range from deep amber to brown in colour. Caramel and chocolate flavours are evident. Brown ales from northeastern England tend to be strong and malty, often nutty, while those from southern England are usually darker, sweeter and lower in alcohol. North American brown ales are usually drier than their English counterparts, with a slight citrus accent and an aroma, bitterness, and medium body due to American hop varieties. Fruitiness from esters are subdued. When chilled to cold temperatures, some haziness may be noticed."
Wheat beer,Ale,#FFBF42,4.0–8.0%,10–35,"Wheat beer is a beer, usually top-fermented, which is brewed with a large proportion of wheat relative to the amount of malted barley. The two main varieties are Weissbier, based on the German tradition, and Witbier, based on the Belgian tradition; minor types include Lambic (made with wild yeasts and bacteria), Berliner Weisse (a cloudy, sour beer), and Gose (a German-type sour, salty, herbal beer).
wo common varieties of wheat beer are Weißbier (German – ""white beer"") based on the German tradition of mixing at least 50% wheat to barley malt to make a light coloured top-fermenting beer, and witbier (Dutch – ""white beer"") based on the Belgian tradition of using flavorings such as coriander and orange peel. Belgian white beers are often made with raw unmalted wheat, as opposed to the malted wheat used in other varieties.
Both German Weißbier and Belgian witbier are termed ""white beers"" because ""wheat"" has the same etymological root as ""white"" in most West Germanic languages (including English).
U.S. brewers and Canadian brewers follow both of the main wheat beer traditions, usually with greater variation.
In Britain, wheat beer is not considered traditional;"
Pilsner,Lager,#FBB123,4.1-9.0%,25-65,"Pilsner styles of beer originate from Bohemia in the Czech Republic. They are medium- to medium-full bodied and are characterized by high carbonation and tangy Czech varieties of hops that impart floral aromas and a crisp, bitter finish. German pilsner styles are similar, though often slightly lighter in body and color. The hallmark of a fresh pilsner is the dense, white head. The alcohol levels must be such as to give a rounded mouthfeel, typically around 5 percent ABV. Classic pilsners are thoroughly refreshing, but they are delicate and must be fresh to show their best. Few beers are as disappointing to the beer lover as a stale pilsner. Great pilsners are technically difficult to make and relatively expensive to produce.
Pilsners are one of the more recent styles to be “imperialized,” with their characteristics, generally alcohol and hops, bumped up sufficiently to constitute a new style, but with a familiar profile. These new imperial pilsners may sacrifice pilsner’s famed delicacy, but they retain the floral aromas and dry, bitter finish of their progenitor style."
Stout,Ale,#470606,3.2-12.0%,15-90,"Stout is a dark, top-fermented beer with a number of variations, including dry stout, Baltic porter, milk stout, and imperial stout.
The first known use of the word stout for beer was in a document dated 1677 found in the Egerton Manuscripts, the sense being that a ""stout beer"" was a strong beer, not a dark beer. The name porter was first used in 1721 to describe a dark brown beer that had been made with roasted malts. Because of the huge popularity of porters, brewers made them in a variety of strengths. The stronger beers, typically 7% or 8% alcohol by volume (ABV), were called ""stout porters"", so the history and development of stout and porter are intertwined, and the term stout has become firmly associated with dark beer, rather than just strong beer."
Porter,Ale,#5A0A02,4.0-10.0%,20-45,"Porter is a dark style of beer developed in London from well-hopped beers made from brown malt. The name was first recorded in the 18th century, and is thought to come from its popularity with street and river porters, who carried objects for others.
The history and development of stout and porter beer types are intertwined. The name ""stout"", used for a dark beer, is believed to have come about because strong porters were marketed under such names as ""extra porter"", ""double porter"", and ""stout porter"". The term stout porter would later be shortened to just stout. For example, Guinness Extra Stout was originally called ""Extra Superior Porter"" and was only given the name ""Extra Stout"" in 1840."

Lambic & Sour Ale,Ale,#952D00,3.0-13.0%,5-70,"Includes young lambics, gueuze lambic, fruit lambic, faro. Lambic beers are perhaps the most individualistic style of beer in the world. Lambics are produced in tiny quantities immediately south of the Belgian capital, Brussels. Lambic brewers use native wild yeasts in the open-air fermentation process to produce these specialties. This unusual fermentation, in conjunction with extended aging in oak barrels, imparts a unique vinous character with a refreshing sourness and astonishing complexity. Lambics labeled as gueuze are a blend of young and old beers. Such blending results in a sharp champagne-like effervescence and tart, toasty flavors. Those labeled as faro have had sugar, caramel or molasses added in order to impart a note of sweetness. Lambic beers, however, are more often seen in the United States when they have been flavored with fruits. Kriek (cherry) and framboise (raspberry) are the most popular and traditional fruits employed. Other exotic fruits are widely used in juice form in the more commercial examples of lambic beer, much to the consternation of purist connoisseurs."
Irish Ale,Ale,#CF6900,3.8-6.0%,20-30,"The ales of Ireland have a gentle maltiness, caramelly, earthy notes, and a generally restrained hop character. They are session ales, so alcohol is generally at 5% abv or less, though you will find the occasion stronger example. The major macrobrewed Irish ales are red ales, but the majority of examples are from New World microbreweries working with Michael Jackson’s description of Irish ale."
American Wild Ale,Ale,#7B1A00,6.0-10.0%,5-30,"Sometimes Belgian influenced, American Wild Ales are beers that are introduced to ""wild"" yeast or bacteria, such as Brettanomyces, Pediococcus, or Lactobacillus. This introduction may occur from oak barrels that have been previously inoculated, pitching into the beer, or gained from various ""sour mash"" techniques. Regardless of the method, these yeast and/or bacteria leave a mark that should be noticeable to strong, and often contribute a sour and/or funky, wild note. Mixed-fermentation examples will display a range of aromatics, rather than a single dominant character."
Belgian Pale Ale,Belgian / French Ale,#D77200,4.5-7.0%,20-30,"The Belgian brewing scene is littered with Belgian Pales, which were initially brewed to compete with Pilseners during the WWII era. Traditionally, they differ from other regional Pale Ales by being less bitter, using aged hops for a delicate hop finish, and having sweet to toasty malt overtones. They should be decanted properly, leaving the yeast in the bottle. This will showcase their brilliant color range from pale straw yellow to various amber hues. Most will be crowned with thick, clinging, rocky white heads. Flavors and aromas will vary. Some have natural spice character contributed by yeast and hops, while others are deliberately spiced. There's also a more recent trend to make hoppier Pale Ales to entice the US market and its hopheads. "
American Pale Ale,Pale Ale,#EA8F00,4.5-6.2%,30-50,"American Pale Ales are light in color, ranging from golden to a light copper color. The style of this beer is typically defined by a balance between pale malts and hop presence - although without the hop intensity or alcohol strength of an IPA. American Pale Ales generally range in strength from c. 4.5% to 6.5% (although there are examples outside of this range)."
India Pale Ale,Pale Ale,#DE7C00,5.0-7.5%,40-70,"India pale ale (IPA) is a hoppy beer style within the broader category of pale ale. 
The story of India pale ale (IPA) is one of the most romantic in the history of beer. At the height of its empire, Britain had emigrants, sailors and troops all around the world—with India being one of its most important outposts. All demanded beer, but India itself was too warm for brewing. To meet that need, London brewers who supplied ale learned through experience that the voyage to India could be tough on perishable beers.
George Hodgson, a London brewer in the late 1700s, used his connections to the East India Co. to dominate the export market to the colony. Among other beers, Hodgson exported a strong pale ale. It was probably brewed with extra additions of hops and at higher alcohol levels, both of which act as preservatives. The long voyage transformed the beer into a wonderful drink.
But Hodgson overreached, and that opened the door to the brewers of Burton-on-Trent, in the English Midlands. The pale ale coming from the Trent valley tasted far better than London brews, because its hard water produced a brighter ale—one with a pleasant and refreshing hop character.
Burton brewmaster Samuel Allsop succeeded in brewing one of exceptional quality. It displaced the London beers to become the preferred export to the English colonies. This came to be called India pale ale, or IPA."
American Pale Lager,American Lager,#FFCA5A,4.0-6.0%,18-25,"The most common lager beers in worldwide production are pale lagers. The flavor of these lighter lagers is usually mild, and the producers often recommend that the beers be served refrigerated. Pale lager is a very pale to golden-colored lager with a well attenuated body and noble hop bitterness. "
American Adjunct Lager,American Lager,#FFD878,4.0-6.0%,8-18,"Light bodied, pale, fizzy lagers made popular by the large macro-breweries (large breweries) of America after Prohibition. Low bitterness, thin malts, and moderate alcohol. Focus is less on flavor and more on mass-production and consumption, cutting flavor and sometimes costs with adjunct cereal grains, like rice and corn."
American Wheat,Wheat beer,#FFBF42,4.0-5.0%,15-30,"American-style wheat ales are clear or hazy, clean and crisp golden-colored beers fermented with a non-European yeast strain. Although they may look similar to German weizens, they do not taste like them. Estery and phenolic German weizen yeast aromas and flavors typically will not be found in these beers. Beers in this category feature American hops varieties, ranging from low to high hop bitterness; they are usually available only in summer months, but some are year-round brews."
Strong Ale,Pale Ale,#B54C00,5.5-9.0%,30-60,"Strong ales are sometimes referred to as old ales, stock ales or winter warmers. These beers are higher alcohol versions (typically between 5.5-7 percent ABV) of pale ales, though not as robust or alcoholic as barley wines. Usually a deep amber color, these brews generally have a sweet malty palate and a degree of fruitiness. If bottle conditioned, strong ales can improve for several years, in some cases eventually obtaining sherry-like notes."
Belgian Dark Ale,Belgian / French Ale,#B04500,4.5-7.5%,15-25,"Belgian Darks offer a massive range of characters. The colors play within the amber to light brown and even deep garnet range of hues, topped with thick, rocky heads of great retention. Aromas can offer anything from traces of yeast, spices, malt, floral attributes, and on occasion, slightly intoxicating notes. Flavors run the gamut from dry and spiced, to sweet and malty. Most examples of Belgian Dark Ale have a low level of bitterness."
Weissbier,German Lager,#FFBF42,4.3-5.6%,8-15,"Weissbier is the classical wheat beer of Bavaria and one of Germany’s greatest and most distinctive beer styles. Weissbier means “white beer” in German. This name derives from the yellowish-white tinge that is imparted by the pale wheat and barley malts from which the beer is made. Outside Bavaria, most weissbier is better known as hefeweizen, literally “yeast wheat” in German. This name is derived from the fact that it is a wheat-based beer that is usually packaged unfiltered, with plenty of yeast turbidity in the finished beer. According to German law, a beer that is labeled hefeweizen, weizenbier, or weissbier (these three terms are largely interchangeable, but there is also a filtered version of weissbier called “kristallweizen”) must be made with at least 50% malted wheat.
"
Bock,German Lager,#A63E00,6.3-7.6%,20-30,"Bock is a bottom fermenting lager that generally takes extra months of lagering (cold storage) to smooth out such a strong brew. Bock beer in general is stronger than your typical lager, more of a robust malt character with a dark amber to brown hue. Hop bitterness can be assertive enough to balance, though must not get in the way of the malt flavor, most are only lightly hopped."
English Pale Ale,Pale Ale,#FFBF42,3.8-6.0%,20-40,"The English Pale Ale can be traced back to the 19th century and the city of Burton-upon-Trent, a place with an abundance of hard water, rich in calcium sulfate. As well as enhancing a beer's hop bitterness, this hard water helps achieve clarity. English Pale Ale can fall anywhere on the color spectrum between golden and reddish amber and should generally have good head retention. A mix of fruity, hoppy, earthy, buttery, and malty aromas and flavors can be found in the sip, not unlike a classic Bitter. Traditionally all ingredients are English in origin."
Munich Lager,German Lager,#B54C00,4.0-6.0%,15-25,"Munich malt can provide a bready, richly malty quality that enhances the malt backbone of a beer without adding residual sweetness. Darker Munich malts can add a deeply toasted malt quality similar to toasted bread crusts. Dunkel is the German word meaning dark, and dunkel beers typically range in colour from amber to dark reddish brown, and are characterized by their smooth malty flavor."
Imperial Stout,Stout,#470606,7.0-12.0%,50-80,"The Imperial Stout is the strongest in alcohol and body of the Stouts. Black in color, these beers typically have an extremely rich malty flavor and aroma with full, sweet malt character. Bitterness can come from roasted malts or hop additions."
Belgian Abbey / Trappist,Belgian Pale Ale,#C35900,7.0-14.0%,20-35,"Belgian Strong Ales can vary from pale to dark brown in color, darker ales may be colored with dark candy sugar. Hop flavor can range from low to high, while hop aroma is low. The beers are medium to full-bodied and have a high alcoholic character. Types of beers included here include tripels, dubbels and ultra-strong abbey ales."
Belgian Strong Dark Ale,Belgian Dark Ale,#BB5100,7.0-12.0%,25-50,"On the same path as Belgian Dark Ale but obviously higher in alcohol with more character all around. The alcohol can be deceivingly hidden or very bold and in your face. Look for lots of complexity within a surprisingly delicate palate. Hop and malt character can vary, but most Strong Dark Ales are full of fruity and strong dark malt flavors. Phenols will range from minimal to high and most examples will be light on the hops. All in all, most of these beers are spicy and alcoholic."
Belgian Strong Pale Ale,Belgian Pale Ale,#FFBF42,7.0-12.0%,20-40,"Like a Belgian Pale Ale, the strong versions will also be pale straw to deep golden in color. What sets them apart is a much higher alcohol content that can range from deliciously hidden to devastatingly present. Expect a complex and powerful ale, yet delicate with rounded flavors and a big, billowy, rocky, white head. Hop and malt character can vary, although most are fruity and quite hoppy. In general, hop flavor and aroma will be within the low range and artfully balanced. Duvel is the hallmark of this style, and many other breweries have tried to imitate Duvel Moortgat's quintessential example with similar references to the devil."
Abbey Single Ale,Belgian Abbey / Trappist,#FFBF42,4.5–7.0% ,20–30,"Traditionally, they differ from other regional Pale Ales by being less bitter, using aged hops for a delicate hop finish, and having sweet to toasty malt overtones. They should be decanted properly, leaving the yeast in the bottle. This will showcase their brilliant color range from pale straw yellow to various amber hues. Most will be crowned with thick, clinging, rocky white heads. Flavors and aromas will vary. Some have natural spice character contributed by yeast and hops, while others are deliberately spiced. There's also a more recent trend to make hoppier Pale Ales to entice the US market and its hopheads. See: De Ranke XX Bitter."
Altbier,Other,#CB6200,4.0–7.0%,25–50,"A Düsseldorf specialty, an Altbier is a German-style Brown Ale. The word alt literally translates to ""old"" in German, and traditionally Altbiers are conditioned for a longer than normal periods of time. Other sources note that ""alt"" is derived from the Latin word ""altus,"" which means ""high"" and refers to the rising yeast. Take your pick, but the extended conditioning mellows out this ale's fruitiness and produces an exceptionally smooth, clean, and delicate brew. Its color ranges from amber to dark brown, carbonation is moderate, and while known to express the slightly spicy, herbal character of Noble hops, the key word here is balance. A stronger version brewed less frequently, ""Sticke Alt"" is a maltier and hoppier take on the Altbier.\"
American Amber / Red Ale,American Pale Ale,#CB6200,4.4–6.1%,25–45,"Like most amber beers, American amber ale is named after the golden to amber color this American version of English pale ale exhibits. The color is derived from the use of caramel and crystal malt additions, which are roasted to provide amber beers with the color, body and flavor many beer fans have come to appreciate. Falling under the ale beer type, amber ales ferment at warmer temperatures for what is typically a much shorter amount of time than lager style beers"
American Amber / Red Lager,American Lager,#FFCA5A,4.1-5.1%,30-45,"American Amber/Red lager has little in the way of hop and malt character. A straw to gold, very clean and crisp, highly carbonated lager. Hop aroma and flavor are low to medium-low, deriving from noble-type hops. Hop bitterness is medium. Toasted, biscuit-like, and/or bready malt flavors along with low levels of fermented-malt-derived sulfur compounds may be evident."
American Barleywine,Other,#B54C00,8.5–15%,60–100,"Despite its name, a Barleywine (or Barley Wine) is very much a beer, albeit a strong and often intense beer. In fact, it's one of the strongest styles. Lively and fruity, sometimes sweet, sometimes bittersweet, but always alcoholic. A brew of this strength and complexity can be a challenge to the palate. Expect anything from an amber to a dark brown color, with aromas ranging from rich fruits to bold hops. The body is typically thick, alcohol will definitely be perceived, and flavors range from dominant dark fruits to palate smacking, resiny hops. English varieties are quite different from American efforts, which are often heavily hopped with high alpha oil American hops to create a more bitter brew. English versions tend to be more rounded and balanced with a slightly lower alcohol content, though this is not always the case. Most Barleywines can be cellared for years and will age much like wine."
American Black Ale,India Pale Ale,#440607,6.3-7.6%,50-70,"The American black ale is characterized by the perception of caramel malt and dark roasted malt flavor and aroma. Hop bitterness is perceived to be medium-high to high. Hop flavor and aroma are medium-high. Fruity, citrus, piney, floral and herbal character from hops of all origins may contribute to the overall experience. This beer is often called a black IPA or Cascadian dark ale."
American Blonde Ale,American Pale Ale,#FBB123,4.1–5.1%,15–25,"One of the most approachable styles, a golden or Blonde Ale is an easy-drinking beer that is visually appealing and has no particularly dominating malt or hop characteristics. Rounded and smooth, it is an American classic known for its simplicity. Sometimes referred to as “Golden Ale.” These beers can have honey, spices and fruit added, and may be fermented with lager or ale yeast."
American Brown Ale,Brown Ale,#B04500,4.2–8.8%,25–45,"Roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be of medium intensity in both flavor and aroma for the American brown ale. American-style brown ales have evident low to medium hop flavor and aroma and medium to high hop bitterness. The history of this style dates back to U.S. homebrewers who were inspired by English-style brown ales and porters. It sits in flavor between those British styles and is more bitter than both."
American Dark Wheat Ale,Wheat beer,#7B1A00,4.0–8.0%,10–35,"An Americanized version of a Dunkelweizen, these beers can range in color from garnet or deep amber to ruby brown. Often cloudy with long-lasting heads, this style tends to be light- to medium-bodied with a high level of carbonation. Hop character might be low or moderately high with some fruitiness from ale fermentation, though most examples use of a fairly neutral ale yeast, resulting in a clean fermentation with little to no diacetyl. Flavors of caramel and toasted malts might be present too, just don't expect German Weizen flavors and aromas of banana esters and clove-like phenols."
American Double / Imperial IPA,India Pale Ale,#DE7C00,7.0–12.0%,65–100,"Take an India Pale Ale and feed it steroids, and you'll end up with a Double or Imperial IPA. Although generally recognizable alongside its sister styles in the IPA family, you should expect something more robust, malty, and alcoholic with a characteristically intense hop profile in both taste and aroma. In short, these are boldly flavored, medium-bodied beers that range in color from deep gold to medium amber. The ""imperial"" usage comes from Russian Imperial Stout, a style of strong Stout originally brewed in England during the late 1700s for the Russian imperial court. Today Double IPA is often the preferred name in the United States."
American Double / Imperial Pilsner,Pilsner,#FBB123,6.5-9.0%,30-65,"Similar to a Pilsner in appearance, but expect a more pronounced malty backbone and an intense bitterness. Malt flavors tend to be quite sweet in many examples. Alcohol can be quite aggressive and lend some spicy notes to the flavor."
American Double / Imperial Stout,Stout,#470606,7.0-12.0%,50-80,"The American-style Imperial Stout is the strongest in alcohol and body of the Stouts. Black in color, these beers typically have an extremely rich malty flavor and aroma with full, sweet malt character. Bitterness can come from roasted malts or hop additions."
American India Pale Lager,American Pale Lager,#FBB123,4.5-7.0%,25-50,"Similar to a Pale Lager, the beers in this style are produces as an IPA, but with Lager yeast. Very pale to golden-colored lager with a well attenuated body and noble hop bitterness. 
India Pale Lagers have a more significant hop flavor, moderate bitterness, and both are backed by a solid malt body and sweet notes from an all-malt base."
American IPA,India Pale Ale,#DE7C00,5.5–7.5%,50–71,"Today's American IPA is a different soul from the IPA style first reincarnated in the 1980s. More flavorful and aromatic than the withering English IPA, its color can range from very pale golden to reddish amber. Hops are the star here, and those used in the style tend to be American with an emphasis on herbal, piney, and/or fruity (especially citrusy) varieties. Southern Hemisphere and experimental hops do appear with some frequency though, as brewers seek to distinguish their flagship IPA from a sea of competitors. Bitterness levels vary, but typically run moderate to high. Medium bodied with a clean, bready, and balancing malt backbone, the American IPA has become a dominant force in the marketplace, influencing brewers and beer cultures worldwide."
American Malt Liquor,American Adjunct Lager,#FFCA5A,6.0-9.0%,10-30,"Straw to pale amber in color, most Malt Liquors are made with excessive amounts of adjuncts, such as corn, rice, and refined brewing sugar (dextrose). As a result, there are very few ""all malt"" malt liquors. Hops are used sparingly, just enough bitterness to balance off any cloyingness. Higher alcohol versions tend to have loads of fusel alcohol, which gives off solvent or fuel-like aromas and flavors. They are highly attenuated, meaning a higher ratio of fermentable sugars are present compared to some other beers, allowing the brewer to achieve a high alcohol content without using as many ingredients. Some breweries enable the use of special enzymes to further break down the malt and adjuncts so they will yield a higher percentage of alcohol. This makes for quite a dry beer, with only a small amount of unfermented sugars and a strong kick from the higher ABV. For the most part, Malt Liquor beers are sold in 40-ounce bottles."
American Pale Ale (APA),Pale Ale,#EA8F00,4.5–6.5%,25–50,"Originally British in origin, this style is now popular worldwide and the use of local or imported ingredients produces variances in character from region to region. American versions tend to be cleaner and hoppier (with the piney, citrusy Cascade variety appearing frequently) than British versions, which are usually more malty, buttery, aromatic, and balanced. Pale Ales range in color from deep gold to medium amber. Fruity esters and diacetyl can vary from none to moderate, and hop aroma can range from lightly floral to bold and pungent. In general, expect a good balance of caramel malt and expressive hops with a medium body and a mildly bitter finish."
American Pale Wheat Ale,American Wheat,#FFBF42,4.0-7.0%,10-35,"An Americanized version of a Hefeweizen, these beers typically fall between pale straw and deep gold in color. Pale Wheat Ales are reminiscent of a Hefeweizen in appearance, unless filtered. Higher carbonation is proper as is a long-lasting head and a light to medium body. German Weizen flavors and aromas of banana esters and clove-like phenols won't be found. Most use a substantial percentage of wheat malt. Hop character could be low or fairly high, but most examples are moderate in bitterness. There may be some fruitiness from ale fermentation though most examples use a fairly neutral ale yeast, resulting in a clean fermentation with little to no diacetyl. Often served with a lemon wedge to either cut the wheat or yeast edge, many people either find this to be a flavorful snap or an insult that damages the beer's taste and head retention."
American Pilsner,Pilsner,#FFBF42,4.9-6.0%,25-40,"Pilsner generally refers to pale, hoppy lagers. From Classic German Pilsners, which tend to be light-to-medium bodied, semi-sweet to off-dry, hopped with German noble hops, to New World artisan renditions in North America, New Zealand, and elsewhere, which showcase modern hop varieties. A separate style category is maintained for Czech Pilsner / Svetly."
American Porter,Porter,#5A0A02,4.0-7.0%,20-40,"nspired by the storied English Porter, the American Porter tends to make its own rules. With plenty of innovation and originality brewers in the US have taken this style to a new level, whether it's highly hopping the brew or adding coffee or chocolate to complement the highly roasted and burnt flavor associated with this type of beer. Some are even barrel aged in bourbon or whiskey barrels. The color could be medium brown to inky black and the range of hop bitterness is also quite wide, but most are balanced. And quite a few easy drinking session Porters can be found as well."
American Stout,Stout,#470606,5.7-8.9%,35-60,"Strikingly bold and undeniably beautiful, the American Stout beer style blends generous amounts of dark malts with American hops to offer an adventurous experience that is unmatched by other styles of beer. Are you afraid of the dark? When it comes to American Stout, don’t be. Allow your senses to run wild with this deceivingly sophisticated take on a European staple. Like many other beer styles that have become prized by American brewers and beer lovers alike, American Stout is a distinct variant of a European Stout beer counterpart. True to style, American stouts showcase generous quantities of the American hops fans have come to expect, and much like other Stout beer types, American stout can be enjoyed year-round but is commonly considered a beer for the fall or winter months."
American Strong Ale,Strong Ale,#CB6200,7.0-20%,40-100,"A catch-all style category for beers from 7 percent alcohol by volume and above. Some may even be as high as 20 percent ABV. As a result, color, aroma, and flavor characteristics will greatly vary; some have similarities to Barleywines and Old Ales. Barrel aging is certainly not out of the question."
American White IPA,India Pale Ale,#F8A600,5.0-7.0%,40-70,"The white IPA is basically a marriage of two distinct beer styles; the American IPA with its high hop character and the wheat-based Belgian Wit with its refreshing and spicy presence. Often hazy in appearance, with a color ranging across the gold spectrum, from deep to pale. Usually presents a moderate to large, long-lasting white head of dense bubbles. May present light to medium spice aromas of coriander and/or pepper. These aromas come from actual spice additions and/or the work of Belgian yeast. Some fruity esters (banana, citrus, apricot) will likely be noticeable. Hop aroma is low to moderate with qualities such as citrus, tropical, and stone fruit coming from American and/or New World varieties."
Baltic Porter,Porter,#882300,6.5-10.0%,20-45,"Porters of the late 1700's were quite strong compared to today's standards, easily surpassing 7 percent alcohol by volume. Some English brewers made a stronger, more robust version, to be shipped across the North Sea that they dubbed a Baltic Porter. In general, the style's dark brown color covered up cloudiness and the smoky, roasted brown malts and bitter tastes masked brewing imperfections. Historically, the addition of stale ale also lent a pleasant acidic flavor to the style, which made it quite popular. These issues were quite important given that most breweries at the time were getting away from pub brewing and opening up production facilities that could ship beer across the world."
Belgian IPA,Belgian Pale Ale,#EA8F00,6.0-11.0%,50-80,"Inspired by American India Pale Ales and Double IPAs, more and more Belgian brewers (like Chouffe & Urthel) are brewing hoppy pale colored ales for the US market. There's been an increase of American brewers making Belgian IPAs, too. Generally, Belgian IPAs are considered too hoppy by Belgian beer drinkers. Various malts are used, but the beers of this style are finished with Belgian yeast strains (bottle-conditioned) while the hops employed tend to be American. You'll generally find a cleaner bitterness versus American IPAs, and a pronounced dry edge, akin to an IPA crossed with a Belgian Tripel. Alcohol by volume is on the high side. Many examples are quite cloudy, and feature tight lacing, excellent head retention, and fantastic billowy heads that mesmerize (thanks, in part, to the hops). Belgian IPA is still very much a developing style."
Berliner Weissbier,Weissbier,#FFD878,2.8-3.4%,3-6,"Low in alcohol, refreshingly tart, and often served with a flavored syrup like Woodruff or raspberry, the Berliner-style Weisse presents a harmony between yeast and lactic acid. These beers are very pale in color, and may be cloudy as they are often unfiltered. Hops are not a feature of this style, but these beers often do showcase esters. Traditional versions often showcase Brettanomyces yeast. Growing in popularity in the U.S., where many brewers are now adding traditional and exotic fruits to the recipe, resulting in flavorful finishes with striking, colorful hues. These beers are incredible when pairing. Bitterness, alcohol and residual sugar are very low, allowing the beer’s acidity, white bread and graham cracker malt flavors to shine. Carbonation is very high, adding to the refreshment factor this style delivers. Many examples of this style contain no hops and thus no bitterness at all."
Biere de Garde,Belgian / French Ale,#CF6900,4.4-8.0%,20-30,"Biere de Garde translates as “beer for keeping.” This style is popping up more and more from US producers. Blonde, amber and brown versions exist. Biere de Garde examples are light amber to chestnut brown or red in color. This style is characterized by a toasted malt aroma and slight malt sweetness. Flavor of alcohol is evident. Often bottle-conditioned, with some yeast character."
Braggot,Other,#FBB123,6.0-12.0%,20-40,"With references dating into the 12th century, Braggot was historically made by blending spices and herbs with mead and beer. Many taverns would make this blend right at the bar, though brewers would also blend them as well. The ultimate goal is a beverage with perceivable honey and beer qualities (meaning malt, hops and/or yeast) that compliment each other, though not necessarily equally present. Ideally, there should be a balance between the honey character and malt flavor with the hop bitterness not overpowering the sweetness while remaining noticeable."
California Common / Steam Beer,Other,#CF6900,4.0-6.0%,35-45,"The California Common, or Steam Beer, is a hybrid style unique to the US. It's usually brewed with a special strain of lager yeast that works better at warmer (ale-like) temperatures. This method dates back to the late 1800's in California when refrigeration was a great luxury. At the time, brewers had to improvise to cool the beer down, so shallow fermenters were used. In a way, the lager yeast was trained to ferment quicker at warmer temperatures. Today's examples are light amber to tawny red in color, medium bodied, and possess a malty character. Some mildly fruitiness along with an herbal yet assertive hop bitterness are also typical. San Francisco's Anchor Brewing Company trademarked the term ""Steam Beer"" and as such all other examples of the style must be legally referred to as ""California Common."""
Chile Beer,Other,#FEEB84,4.5-6.0%,0-0,"Beers with the addition of hot pepper juice, oils, or actual peppers, most commonly jalapeño chiles. Hotness can range from a subtle spiciness to palate scorching. Most often, chiles are added to pale ales and light lagers, but the base beer style can vary."
Cider,Other,#FBB123,3.0-15.0%,0-5,"Made from fermented apple juice, cider comes in a number of varieties. English cider is dry, with fruity, tannic qualities and low carbonation. This can be found cask-conditioned in England. Normandy is another major cider-producing region, with a sweeter, more effervescent, very complex style. Ciders produced elsewhere are often sweet, simple beverages for mass consumption, though there are some good English-style ciders in North America and Norman-style ciders in Quebec."
Cream Ale,Other,#FFCA5A,4.0-8.5%,10-22,"Cream Ales, spawned from the American light lager style, are brewed as an ale though are sometimes finished with a lager yeast or with lager beer mixed into the final product. Adjuncts such as corn or rice are frequently used to lighten the body but it is not uncommon for smaller craft brewers to make all malt Cream Ales. Pale straw to pale gold in color, they were known to have a low degree of hop bittering yet some hop aroma. More recently, a number of breweries have put their stamp on the style by giving it more of a hoppy character, nudging it toward Imperial. Well carbonated and well attenuated."
Czech Pilsener,Pilsner,#FBB123,4.1-5.1%,30-45,"Also known as Bohemian Pilsener, has a slightly sweet and evident malt character and a toasted, biscuit-like, bready malt character. Hop bitterness is perceived as medium with a low to medium-low level of noble-type hop aroma and flavor. This style originated in 1842, with “pilsener” originally indicating an appellation in the Czech Republic. Classic examples of this style used to be conditioned in wooden tanks and had a less sharp hop bitterness despite the similar IBU ranges to German-style Pilsener. Low-level diacetyl is acceptable. Bohemian-Style Pilseners are darker in color and higher in final gravity than their German counterparts."
Doppelbock,Bock,#BB5100,6.6-7.9%,17-27,"“Doppel” meaning “double,” this style is a bigger and stronger version of the lower-gravity German-Style Bock beers. Originally made by monks in Munich, the Doppelbock beer style is very food-friendly and rich in melanoidins reminiscent of toasted bread. Color is copper to dark brown. Malty sweetness is dominant but should not be cloying. Malt character is more reminiscent of fresh and lightly toasted Munich-style malt, more so than caramel or toffee malt. Doppelbocks are full-bodied, and alcoholic strength is on the higher end."
Dortmunder / Export Lager,German Lager,#FFD878,5.1-6.1%,23-29,"Sometimes referred to as a “Dortmunder export,” the European-Style Export has the malt-forward flavor and sweetness of a German-style Helles, but the bitter base of a German-style Pilsener. This lager is all about balance, with medium hop character and firm but low malt sweetness. Look for toasted malt flavors and spicy floral hop aromas."
Dubbel,Belgian Strong Dark Ale,#C35900,6.0-9.0%,15-30,"The Belgian Dubbel is a rich, malty beer with some spicy or phenolic and mild alcoholic characteristics. Not as much fruitiness as a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, but some dark fruit aromas and flavors may be present. Medium amber to deep brown, this style is recognizable for its mild hop bitterness with no lingering hop flavors. A Dubbel is also likely show signs of a sweeter caramel flavor from the use of crystal malt or dark candi sugar. Look for a medium to full body with an expressive carbonation and some dryness in the finish. Traditionally a Trappist ale, many breweries now make similar ""Abbey Dubbels"" to try and emulate the monastic originals (Trappist Westvleteren 8, Westmalle Trappist Dubbel, and Chimay Première)."
Dunkelweizen,Weissbier,#952D00,4.0-7.0%,10-15,"Similar to a Hefeweizen, these southern German wheat beers are brewed as darker versions (Dunkel means ""dark"") with deliciously complex malts and a low balancing bitterness. Creamy and full-bodied, most Dunkelweizen are medium amber to amber-brown and appear slightly murky from the weizen yeast. Phenolic (clove) and fruity (banana, bubble gum) character will usually be present in the nose, and some examples may even taste like banana bread."
English Barleywine,Other,#B54C00,8.5–15%,60–100,"Despite its name, a Barleywine (or Barley Wine) is very much a beer, albeit a strong and often intense beer. In fact, it's one of the strongest styles. Lively and fruity, sometimes sweet, sometimes bittersweet, but always alcoholic. A brew of this strength and complexity can be a challenge to the palate. Expect anything from an amber to a dark brown color, with aromas ranging from rich fruits to bold hops. The body is typically thick, alcohol will definitely be perceived, and flavors range from dominant dark fruits to palate smacking, resiny hops. English varieties are quite different from American efforts, which are often heavily hopped with high alpha oil American hops to create a more bitter brew. English versions tend to be more rounded and balanced with a slightly lower alcohol content, though this is not always the case. Most Barleywines can be cellared for years and will age much like wine."
English Bitter,Pale Ale,#D77200,3.0-5.0%,20-35,"The Bitter style came from brewers who wanted to differentiate these ales from other mild brews—enter pale malts and more hops. Usually gold to copper in color, most examples are light bodied and low in carbonation. Intended to be sessionable, alcohol should be low and not perceived on the palate. The hop bitterness meanwhile, is moderate to assertive. Most English Bitters have a fruitiness in the aroma and flavor; diacetyl can also be present. These beers are traditionally served cask conditioned, but many breweries now have bottled versions, too."
English Brown Ale,Brown Ale,#BB5100,4.2-7.0%,15-25,"Spawned from the Mild Ale tradition, English Brown Ales tend to be maltier and sweeter on the palate, with a somewhat fuller body. Color can range from a medium amber/reddish hue to dark brown. Some versions will lean towards fruity esters, while others tend to be drier with nutty characteristics. Roasty malt notes give this style complexity, but almost every example has both a minimal amount of hop aroma and low degree of hop bitterness. As with most historical English styles, alcohol levels are kept low to promote drinkability."
English Dark Mild Ale,Brown Ale,#8B2900,3.0-6.0%,20-30,"The quintessential British session beer, like its name suggests, a Mild is known for its low level of hop character. Similarly, the alcohol content is traditionally very low, too. Colors can range from medium amber to rich brown. Low carbonation with a nearly still, slightly bubbly head and little to no hop aroma. Grainy to toasty malts might be present, but expect some body from the high dextrins produced during brewing. Traditionally Dark Milds were a draft beer made popular in London and the Midlands of England."
English India Pale Ale (IPA),India Pale Ale,#DE7C00,4.5-7.0%,35-60,"Historically, English breweries exported a variety of beer styles to colonies across the British empire. But shipping ales to troops stationed in India was a particular challenge in an age when the journey took months and every cask contained wild Brettanomyces yeast. To withstand the voyage, Pale Ales were tweaked to be maltier, higher in alcohol content, and hoppier, as hops are a natural preservative. Historians believe that IPA was then watered down for the troops, while officers and the elite would savor the beer at full strength. Over time, taxation has caused the English IPA to assume a lower alcohol. The leaner the brew the less malt is required, and less is the need for a strong hop presence, which would easily put the brew out of balance. Expect earthy, floral English hop character and a malt profile defined by notes of biscuit, toast, and toffee."
English Pale Mild Ale,Pale Ale,#F8A600,3.0-5.0%,15-25,"Similar in many ways to an ordinary Bitter, yet not as hoppy, the English Pale Mild Ale is a delicate, malt-forward brew. Lighter in color than Dark Milds, this style ranges from a pale amber to a deep amber or even an amber brown. Fruitiness, sulfur, and buttery diacetyl may be present in the nose, while hops—traditionally English in origin—are generally subdued yet offer a balancing bitterness. The low alcohol range makes this type of ale a perfect session beer. Not as popular as it has been in the past, Pale Mild is nonetheless an ale for those who appreciate nuance and a bit of history in their pint glass."
English Stout,Stout,#470606,4.0-7.0%,20-40,"Stouts are typically dark brown to pitch black in color. A common profile among Stouts, but not in all cases, is the use of roasted barley (unmalted barley that is kilned to the point of being charred) which lends a dry character to the beer as well as a huge roasted flavor that can range from burnt to coffee to chocolate. Traditional English Stout recipes rely on bitterness from the roasted grain to provide a dry finish and consequently tend to show very little hop character."
English Strong Ale,Strong Ale,#BB5100,5.5-11.0%,40-60,"Bigger than a Pale Ale yet smaller than a Barleywine, the English Strong Ale is a rich and complex beer. Many examples are unfiltered and bottle conditioned. The color tends to land somewhere between amber and reddish copper. English Strong Ales usually end up as a bold mix of fruity, estery, and malty. Hop character can vary from mildly bitter to a full blown with a bold hop flavor and aroma. Similarly, the alcohol level varies and can be quite noticeable, with a hint of solvent possible."
Euro Dark Lager,European Lager,#A63E00,4.0-7.0%,8-40,"This style encompasses a wide range of dark beers including India Pale Lagers, Czech lagers, and lagers brewed with adjuncts or non-traditional ingredients. In time these entries will be moved into more accurate categories."
Euro Pale Lager,European Lager,#FFBF42,4.0-6.0%,18-25,"Similar to Munich Helles, many European countries reacted to the popularity of early pale lagers by brewing their own. Hop flavor is significant and of noble varieties, bitterness is moderate, and both are backed by a solid malt body and sweet notes from an all-malt base."
Extra Special / Strong Bitter (ESB),English Pale Ale,#C35900,4.0-7.0%,20-40,"Extra Special Bitters are essentially more aggressive and more balanced Bitters, both in alcohol and hop character. They shouldn't be overpowering, however. The color range will be similar, though ESBs lean toward the darker end of the scale; dark golds to copper. Low in carbonation, this style is commonly served on cask. Malts, often toasty and fruity, tend to be more pronounced, with the possibility of some diacetyl notes. And despite the word ""bitter"" in the name, these beers are not really all that bitter. The key to an ESB is balance and drinkability"
Flanders Oud Bruin,Belgian / French Ale,#A13700,4.0-8.0%,20-25,"Oud Bruins, not restricted to, but concentrated in Flanders, are light to medium-bodied and deep copper to brown in color. They are extremely varied, characterized by a slight vinegar or lactic sourness and spiciness to smooth and sweet. A fruity-estery character is apparent with no hop flavor or aroma. Low to medium bitterness. Very small quantities of diacetyl are acceptable. Roasted malt character in aroma and flavor is acceptable, at low levels. Oak-like or woody characteristics may be pleasantly integrated into the overall palate. Typically, old and new Brown Ales are blended, like Lambics."
Flanders Red Ale,Belgian / French Ale,#CB6200,4.6-6.5%,10-25,"A sour, fruity, red wine-like Belgian-style ale with supportive malt flavors and fruit complexity with a dry finish and tannin characteristics. Typically light-bodied with reddish-brown colors, they are known for their distinct sharp, fruity, sour, and tart flavors which are created by special yeast strains. Very complex beers, they are produced under the age-old tradition of long-term cask aging in oak, and the blending of young and old beers."
Foreign / Export Stout,Stout,#470606,5.5-8.0%,30-70,"A special style of Stout that is brewed bigger than normal for a long journey, the more traditional Foreign / Export Stouts will be found in the tropical regions of the world. Higher in alcohol with a very pronounced roasted character. Expect moderate to high roasted grain and malt flavor with a coffee, chocolate, or lightly burnt grain character, although without a sharp bite. Moderately dry with low to medium esters and medium to high bitterness. Moderate to no hop flavor, can be earthy, herbal, or floral."
Fruit / Vegetable Beer,Lambic & Sour Ale,#952D00,3.0-13.0%,5-70,"Fruit beer is made with fruit, or fruit extracts that are added during any portion of the brewing process, providing obvious yet harmonious fruit qualities. This idea is expanded to “field beers” that utilize vegetables and herbs.
This style may includes pumpkin flavored beers that have caught the attention of craft beer and pumpkin lovers everywhere, partially because the flavors can be implemented in several beer styles. Whether you’re interested in trying pumpkin amber ales, IPAs or pumpkin stouts, there are plenty of options from American craft brewers for you to explore."
German Pilsener,Pilsner,#FFCA5A,4.6-5.3%,25-40,"A classic German-style Pilsner is straw to pale in color with a malty sweetness that can be perceived in aroma and flavor. Perception of hop bitterness is medium to high. Noble-type hop aroma and flavor are moderate and quite obvious. Distinctly different from the Bohemian-style pilsner, this style is lighter in color and body and has a lower perceived hop bitterness."
Gose,Lambic & Sour Ale,#FFCA5A,4.4-5.4%,10-15,"Straw to medium amber, the contemporary Gose is cloudy from suspended yeast. A wide variety of herbal, spice, floral or fruity aromas other than found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose are present, in harmony with other aromas. Salt (table salt) character is traditional in low amounts, but may vary from absent to present. Body is low to medium-low. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness."
Grisette,Belgian / French Ale,#C35900,4.5-8.0%,20-40,Fruity esters dominate the aroma. Clarity is good with a large foamy head on top. The addition of several spices and herbs create a complex fruity or citrusy flavor. Light to medium bodied with very high carbonation. Alcohol level is medium to high.
Hefeweizen,Weissbier,#FFBF42,4.0-7.0%,10-15,"A south German style of wheat beer (weissbier) typically made with a ratio of 50 percent barley to 50 percent wheat. Sometimes the percentage of wheat is even higher. ""Hefe"" means ""with yeast,"" hence the beer's unfiltered and cloudy appearance. The particular ale yeast used produces unique esters and phenols of banana and cloves with an often dry and tart edge, some spiciness, and notes of bubblegum or apples. Hefeweizens are typified by little hop bitterness, and a moderate level of alcohol. Often served with a lemon wedge (popularized by Americans), to cut the wheat or yeasty edge, some may find this to be either a flavorful snap or an insult that can damage the beer's taste and head retention."
Herbed / Spiced Beer,Other,#8B2900,2.5-12.0%,5-40,"An herb and spice beer is a lager or ale that contains flavors derived from flowers, roots, seeds or certain fruits or vegetables. Typically the hop character is low, allowing the added ingredient to shine through. The appearance, mouthfeel and aromas vary depending on the herb or spice used. This beer style encompasses innovative examples as well as traditional holiday and winter ales."
Irish Dry Stout,Stout,#520907,4.2-5.3%,30-40,"Dry Stout is black beer with a dry-roasted character thanks to the use of roasted barley. The emphasis on coffee-like roasted barley and a moderate degree of roasted malt aromas define much of the character. Hop bitterness is medium to medium high. This beer is often dispensed via nitrogen gas taps that lend a smooth, creamy body to the palate."
Irish Red Ale,Irish Ale,#CF6900,4.0-6.0%,20-30,"Irish red ale is known for its unique malty taste and is on the lower side of the bitterness and alcohol content scales. If you love American craft beer, the Irish red ale beer remains a great style for beer lovers to seek out and appreciate."
Kolsch,Other,#FFBF42,4.0-6.0%,18-25,"First brewed in Köln, Germany, this formerly obscure style is now found at many US brewpubs and a number of breweries have released their own creative takes using American hops and other nontraditional ingredients. Light to medium in body with a soft mouthfeel and a straw yellow or pale gold color, Kölsch has a spicy, herbal Noble hop bitterness that is medium to slightly assertive—less than a Pilsner, but not by much. A somewhat fruity or vinous (grape-y from malts) quality and a crisp, dryish finish make up the rest of the flavor profile."
Keller Bier / Zwickel Bier,German Lager,#FBB123,4.0-7.0%,20-40,"A rather old, rare, and unique German beer style, Kellerbiers are unfiltered and unpasteurized lagers that date back to at least the Middle Ages. The beer is matured, unbunged (beer is exposed), in deep vaults. The final product is a smooth, naturally cloudy beer that's rich in vitamins from the yeast. Hop bitterness can be high and alcohol will vary. Zwickelbier is similar to a Keller, but not as pronounced."
Kristalweizen,Weissbier,#FFD878,4.0-7.0%,10-15,"A filtered version of a Hefeweizen, showcasing a bright and clear body that ranges from pale straw to light amber in color. The overall character will be cleaner and softer on the palate, and the typical banana and phenols will be more subtle."
Light Lager,American Lager,#FFD878,2.5-5.0%,8-12," Light Lager is generally a lighter version of a brewery's premium lager, some are lower in alcohol but all are lower in calories and carbohydrates compared to other beers. Typically a high amount of cereal adjuncts like rice or corn are used to help lighten the beer as much as possible. Very low in malt flavor with a light and dry body. The hop character is low and should only balance with no signs of flavor or aroma. European versions are about half the alcohol (2.5-3.5% ABV) as their regular beer, yet show more flavor (some use 100 percent malt) then the American counterparts. For the most part, this style has the least amount of flavor than any other style of beer."
Low Alcohol Beer,American Adjunct Lager,#FEEB84,0.1-1.0%,10-20,"Low Alcohol Beer is also commonly known as Non Alcohol (NA) beer, despite containing small amounts of alcohol. Low Alcohol Beers are generally subjected to one of two things: a controlled brewing process that results in a low alcohol content, or the alcohol is removed using a reverse-osmosis method which passes alcohol through a permeable membrane. They tend to be very light on aroma, body, and flavor."
Marzen / Oktoberfest,German Lager,#CB6200,5.0-6.5%,18-25,"Before refrigeration, it was nearly impossible to brew beer in the summer due to the hot weather and bacterial infections. Brewing ended with the coming of spring, and began again in the fall. Thus, most were brewed in March (Märzen). These beers were kept in cold storage through the spring and summer months, or brewed at a higher gravity, so theywould last longer. Märzenbier is full-bodied, rich, and toasty, with a moderately high alcohol content. Its color can be anywhere from pale gold to medium amber, but is typically some shade of copper. Like other dark lagers, the aroma is driven by malt, not hops. Best enjoyed by the half liter in a Bavarian beer garden."
Maibock / Helles Bock,Bock,#EA8F00,6.3-8.1%,20-38,"Also called “Heller Bock” (meaning “Pale Bock”), the German-Style Maibock is paler in color and more hop-centric than traditional Bock beers. A lightly toasted and/or bready malt character is often evident."
Mead,Other,#FBB123,10-17%,5-30,"Mead is a drink made from fermented honey. This gives a somewhat sweet aroma and flavor to the drink. Overall, however, the sweetness generally does not overpower the sharpness of the alcohol. Some brewers also use specific types of honey made from specific flowers and bees to impart subtle flavor differences. The ABV for mead can vary widely. In examples with a high ABV, the alcohol will be very notable in both aroma and flavor."
Milk / Sweet Stout,Stout,#470606,3.2-6.3%,15-25,"Sweet Stout, also referred to as Cream Stout or Milk Stout, is black in color. Malt sweetness, chocolate, and caramel should dominate the flavor profile and contribute to the aroma. It also should have a low to medium-low roasted malt/barley-derived bitterness. Milk sugar (lactose) lends the style more body. This beer does use lactose sugar, so people with an intolerance should probably avoid this style."
Munich Dunkel Lager,Munich Lager,#952D00,4.0-6.0%,15-25,"An old friend of Bavaria, Munich Dunkels are smooth, rich, and complex without being overly heady or heavy. They boast brilliant ruby hues from the large amounts of Munich malts used, and these malts also create a fuller-bodied beer. In addition, the decoction brewing process lends much depth and richness of flavor. Little to no hop aroma is detectable; the nose is dominated by malty notes of bread, nuts, and perhaps a touch of chocolate. Hop varieties used tend to be German Noble varieties like Tettnanger and Hallertau. Bitterness is often moderate, with just enough to balance out any sweetness."
Munich Helles Lager,Munich Lager,#FFBF42,4.8-5.6%,18-25,"“Helles” means “pale in color,” as these beers are often golden. The German-style Helles lager is a bit rounder or fuller-bodied than light lager and even all-malt pilsners. Helles lager beers offer a touch of sweetness that balance a measurable addition of spicy German hop flavor and light bitterness. The malt character is soft and bready, making it a terrific complement to light dishes such as salad or fresh shellfish, like clams. Clean and crisp, this is a refreshing beer with substance. Low levels of yeast-produced sulfur aromas and flavors may be common."
Oatmeal Stout,Stout,#5A0A02,3.8-6.1%,20-40,"The addition of oatmeal adds a smooth, rich body to the Oatmeal Stout. This beer style is dark brown to black in color. Roasted malt character is caramel-like and chocolate-like, and should be smooth and not bitter. Coffee-like roasted barley and malt aromas are prominent. This low- to medium-alcohol style is packed with darker malt flavors and a rich and oily body from oatmeal."
Old Ale,Strong Ale,#B54C00,6.0-12.0%,30-65,"Old Ales, also referred to in the past as Stock Ales, are low attenuated beers with high levels of dextrins, creating a full malt body with plenty of character. Old Ales from centuries past were often transferred into vats to mature, hence the name. Commonly a rich, dark amber to a deep brown color, some examples are nearly black. Tamed aromatics. Although bittering levels can greatly vary, expect fruity, vinous, intense malt flavors and sharp alcohol characteristics. The often racy but mellow attitude of the beer may also include acidic notes, raisins, and black currants. Vintage varieties may have a low level of oxidation while stronger versions sometimes exhibit similarities to port wine. Brewers may also inoculate a portion of the batch with Brettanomyces lambicus and age it for an extended period of time to achieve an old-school acidic character."
Pumpkin Ale,American Wild Ale,#8B2900,2.3-12.0%,5-70,"Nothing says fall quite like pumpkins and beer, and American craft breweries have done a superb job of combining the two. It’s tough to find anything that hasn’t been “pumpkin spiced,” and beers are no different. Pumpkin flavored beers have caught the attention of craft beer and pumpkin lovers everywhere, partially because the flavors can be implemented in several beer styles. Whether you’re interested in trying pumpkin amber ales, IPAs or pumpkin stouts, there are plenty of options from American craft brewers for you to explore."
Quadrupel (Quad),Belgian Strong Dark Ale,#952D00,9.0-14.0%,25-50,"Inspired by the Trappist brewers of Belgium, a Quadrupel is a Belgian-style ale of great strength with even bolder flavor compared to its sister styles Dubbel and Tripel. Typically a dark creation that plays within the deep red and ruby brown end of the spectrum with garnet hues it is a full bodied beer with a rich, malty palate and spicy phenols than are usually kept to a moderate level. Sweet on the palate with a low bitterness yet well perceived alcohol, Quads are well suited to cellaring."
Radler / Shandy,Other,#FEEB84,2.5-7.0%,0-15,"A mix of a sweet soft drink or juice -- typically lemon or ginger but sometimes apple, grapefruit, or other fruit -- and beer, often in equal parts, that is moderately sweet, thirst quenching, and low in alcohol with medium to spritzy carbonation. It is often but not necessarily sold as a Summer seasonal. Category includes such regional styles as diesel -- beer and cola, cola-weizen -- wheat beer and cola, and Russ'n. There must be at least 50% beer or cider in this drink to be rateable on RateBeer."
Rauchbier,German Lager,#B54C00,4.8-6.0%,20-30,"Rauchbier is an old German beer style with origins in the 1500s from the district of Franconia and the town of Bamberg. Typically dark to amber in color, it shares similarities with Oktoberfestbier. Green malts are dried over an open fire of beechwood, imparting a unique smokiness (""rauch"" is German for smoke) to the final beverage. Expect toasty-rich malt in aroma and flavor, restrained bitterness, low to high smoke flavor, clean fermentation profile, and an attenuated finish."
Roggenbier,German Ale,#BB5100,4.5-6.0%,10-20,"Roggenbier is akin to a Dunkelweizen made with rye rather than wheat, but with a greater body and light finishing hops. Expect a very pronounced spiciness and sour-like rye character, malty flavor, and a clean hop character. Often unfiltered and bottle-conditioned, Roggenbiers tend to be rather turbid and foamy."
Russian Imperial Stout,Imperial Stout,#440607,8.0-12.0%,50-90,"Russian Imperial Stout, first brewed in England for Emperor Peter the Great of Russia, are higher in alcohol than traditional English Stouts. The best examples are full bodied, rich, and complex, and will often have flavors and aromas of dried fruit, coffee, and dark chocolate. Often dry, flavors of higher alcohol is quite evident. Hop character can vary from none, to balanced or aggressive."
Specialty Grain - Other,Other,#F0F0F0,--,--,"Beer made with a speciality grain, most typically rye, but also common are rice, sorghum, millet, corn, buckwheat, oats and spelt. As this is a catch-all category, alcohol levels, bitterness, and color vary."
Saison / Farmhouse Ale,Belgian / French Ale,#C35900,4.5-8.5%,20-40,"The Saison (or Farmhouse Ale) is a French/Belgian style. It ranges in color from gold to dark amber. They are light to medium in body. The dominant quality in the aroma should be fruity esters, with hints of malt sweetness, spices, a slight sour character, and minimal alcohol. Hop presence in both aroma and flavor can vary widely within the style, from low to medium-high. Spice notes should be evident in both aroma and flavor, usually presenting as black pepper hints. Fruit flavors like dark fruits and bananas should also be noted, along with a very minimal hint of sour. "
Schwarzbier,German Lager,#771900,3.8-5.2%,20-30,"Schwarzbier (""shvahrts-beer""), is simply German for black beer. It doesn't mean that it is necessarily heavy or light in body, although most examples tend to be lighter. Unlike Porters or Stouts and other dark beers, they are not overly bitter with the burnt and heavily roasted malt characteristics that these styles tend to depend on. Instead, hops are used to achieve a good portion of the bitterness. Smooth on the palate, soul lifting, and refreshing with a dry finish, Schwartzbiers make a great alternative for the winter months, especially when you're looking for a lighter beer, but one with depth of color and a bittersweet taste that might bring to mind coffee, cocoa, or licorice."
Scotch Ale / Wee Heavy,Strong Ale,#A13700,6.6-8.5%,25-35,"Scotch Ale was the name given to a strong pale ale from Edinburgh in the 19th century. This was typical of the strong pale ales brewed in Britain at that time - mainly pale barley malt and moderate hopping, and were not that stylistically different to English Strong Ales or Barley Wines. The name however became regionalised so that a strong pale ale from Scotland became known as a Scotch Ale or Wee Heavy. Beers using the designation Scotch Ale are popular in the USA where most examples are brewed locally ale from Scotland became known as a Scotch Ale or Wee Heavy. Beers using the designation Scotch Ale are popular in the USA where most examples are brewed locally."
Smoked Beer,Other,#7B1A00,4.5-7.0%,20-30,"When malt is kilned over an open flame, the smoke flavor becomes infused into the beer, leaving a taste that can vary from dense campfire, to slight wisps of smoke. Any style of beer can be smoked; the goal is to reach a balance between the style’s character and the smoky properties. Originating in Germany as Rauchbier, this style is open to interpretation by U.S. craft brewers. Classic base styles include German-style Marzen/Oktoberfest, German-style Bock, German-style Dunkel, Vienna-style Lager and more. Smoke flavors dissipate over time."
Tripel,Belgian Strong Pale Ale,#EA8F00,8.0-12.0%,20-40,"The name ""Tripel"" actually stems from part of the brewing process, in which brewers use up to three times the amount of malt found in a standard Trappist table beer. Traditionally, Tripels are bright yellow to deep gold in color, a shade or two darker than the average Pilsener. The head should be big, dense, and creamy. Expect a complex aroma and flavor: spicy phenols, powdery yeast, and fruity esters with a sweet finish. Sweetness comes from both the pale malts and the higher alcohol. Bitterness is up there for a strong beer with such a light body, but it can be hard to perceive in well balanced versions. The lighter body comes from the use of Belgian candi sugar (up to 25 percent sucrose), which not only lightens the body, but also adds various alcoholic aromas and flavors. Small amounts of spices are sometimes added as well. Tripels are notoriously alcoholic, yet the best examples hide this quality quite deceivingly, making them beers for sipping."
Vienna Lager,German Lager,#CF6900,4.5-5.5%,15-30,"Named after the city in which it originated, a traditional Vienna Lager is brewed using a three step decoction boiling process. Munich, Pilsner, Vienna, and dextrin malts are used, as well wheat in some cases. Its color reliably falls between pale amber and medium amber—there should be a reddish hue to examples of this style. Noble hops are used subtly, with the resulting beer having a crisp quality, a toasty flavor and some residual caramel-like sweetness. Vienna Lager and German Märzen have much in common. Although Austrian in origin and rare these days, some classic examples come from Mexico, such as Dos Equis Amber, the result of late 19th century brewers immigrating from Austria."
Winter Warmer,Other,#952D00,6.0-8.0%,15-35,"Winter Warmer is a traditional malty-sweet English Strong Ale that is brewed in the winter months. It is usually quite dark, but not as dark as a stout, with a notable malt presence. Spices are sometimes added to the brewing process, especially in the United States."
Witbier,Belgian / French Ale,#FFBF42,4.0-7.0%,10-20,"Belgian in origin, this unfiltered style of ale is pale and cloudy in appearance due to the high level of wheat, and sometimes oats, used in the mash. Always spiced, generally with coriander, orange peel, and occasionally other spices or herbs in the background. The crispness and slight tang comes from the wheat and the lively level of carbonation. This is one style that many US brewers have taken a liking to, and have done a very good job of staying to style. Sometimes served with a lemon, order one without a garnish if you truly want to enjoy the untainted subtleties of this style. Often referred to as ""white beers"" (witbieren) due to the cloudiness created by yeast in suspension."
